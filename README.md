This datapack works alongside a scarpet script
Both Datapack and scarpet script is in the respective folder

Shared Deaths
-----------
Created to play with friends, When one player dies - every player dies. 

This is pretty much finished, unless I find any issues.

LegendaryTooltips
-----------
Requires the Legendary Tooltips mod. https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/legendary-tooltips-fabric

Just includes needed tags for how I like it setup

VaultAdvancements
-----------
Wanted Advancements in [Vault Hunters](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/vault-hunters-1-18-2), so I made them. You can download them in the #fan-art chat of their official discord
